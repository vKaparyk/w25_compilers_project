features of CodeGenerator:
  - global variables
    - simpleDec and ArrayDec
    - if local variables are declared and referred to; will not update global variables
  - assignExp
    - both simplevar and indexvar work
  - chain instructions into each other
    - z = x - x/y*y
  - CallExp
    - can call functions
    - can have return value from that function
    - can pass in arrays
    - input/output works
  - FunDec
    - can decalre functions and call then
    - TODO: function prototypes
    - TODO: recursion
  - SimpleVar
    - global and local declarations
  - OpExp
    - primitive operations (+, -, /, *)
    - unary operations (~(true), -(1))
    - comparistons (eq, neq, gte)
  - IfExp
    - chainable test condition
    - regular if body
    - optional else block
  - WhileExp
    - chainable test condition
    - has body that actually loops
    - will stop if condition is met
  - ReturnExp
    - can have a return value
    - early function stop
