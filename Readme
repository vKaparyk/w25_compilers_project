In this package, we provide a SampleParser that shows you how to build
a scanner and a parser together with JFlex and CUP.  It's intended to 
shorten your learning curve for these tools and you are allowed to use it
as a starting point to build your project implementations.

Also included are five C- programs from the C-Specification for your
convenience during development and testing.
